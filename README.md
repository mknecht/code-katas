# What's a kata?

A [coding kata](http://codekata.com/) is a small coding exercise that you repeat until you can do it without thinking. And fast. At 4am. After 3 days without sleep. Kidding. A bit. Anyhow, the idea is that coders, [like any craftsmen](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), need to be able to do their basic tasks efficiently. Katas is a way to make that happen.

Katas improve my speed in two ways. First, I learn how to do stuff fast that I use often â€” or want to use often, if I could do them fast. Second, as coding these days is mostly about typing text, it shows me the bottlenecks in my editor. And forces me to fix them, because they get *really* annoying the second time they mess with my record. ;)

# My katas

## Python: requests + regex + argparse + pprint

Query a JSON resource over HTTP, evaluate a query and prettyprint the result.

# Other places to look for katas

* [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache) has a few katas in diverse languages to look at. (Haven't tried yet.)
* [checkio](http://www.checkio.org/) tasks may be appropriately sized tasks (once you know what to do), though one can argue the relevancy. 
* The [cyber dojo](http://cyber-dojo.org/) has tons of tasks.
